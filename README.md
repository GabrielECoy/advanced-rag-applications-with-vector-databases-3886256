## Notes
Note: I used a Code space, but the course was expecting to clone the repo in my local drive

How to use each chapter exercise files:
- Spin a virtual environment: python3 -m virtualenv \<ch1\>
  Note: if you get "No module named virtualenv", install it first with pip install virtualenv (I used virtualenv instead of venv, because it was what the course was doing)
- Active it: source \<ch1\>/bin/activate
- Install dependencies: python -m pip install -r \<ch1\>_requirements.txt
Note: When running the cells the code space jupyter notebook for the first time I selected the <ch1> environment as the engine

## Course Description

Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is everywhere these days, and vector databases are what give them their power. But RAG isn’t as simple as some companies claim, so it can be easy to get overwhelmed. In this course, discover state-of-the-art RAG methods, including how to optimize text-based RAG via chunking, embedding, and metadata usage, and how to conduct basic image search with a vector database. You’ll also get a chance to practice multimodal RAG by embedding and storing data and querying images with text. Along the way, instructor Yujian Tang provides practical, hands-on demonstrations and exercise challenges to test out your new skills.

## Installing
1. To use these exercise files, you must have the following installed:
	- Python 3.10 or 3.11
    - requirements.txt
2. Clone this repository into your local machine using the terminal (Mac), CMD (Windows), or a GUI tool like SourceTree.
